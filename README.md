HTML/CSS Trading Card

A marked-up CSS trading card featuring one of my favorite exotic animals, the Jerboa. This small critter has traits reminiscent of a kangaroo/rat/lion/rabbit and deserves to be discovered by the world. An HTML template was provided by Udacity.com, as this was a student project, but most of the code has been reworked to my personal preferences. Please enjoy and use as you see fit.
